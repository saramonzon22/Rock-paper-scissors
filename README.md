I'm doing this little project while practising JavaScript. As I implement improvements or changes in the code I will update it.

### Instructions

It's the classic sleight of hand game but web version. All you have to do is choose which option you want to play. The browser will choose its own and you will see if you win or lose :thought_balloon:

Once you choose, the message will appear and it will show what the browser chose. You can play as many times as you want, the response of the browser will always be different. 

Follow me for updates! :computer:
